      <h2 id="welcome-to-my-academic-website">Welcome to my academic website!</h2>

<p>I am an assistant professor of strategic management at Purdue University, currently visiting the TIES group at MIT Sloan School of Management. Before joining Purdue, I founded and led the R&amp;D group at Creative Destruction Lab, a non-profit mentoring program for technology startups. I continue to help run <a href="https://creativedestructionlab.com/streams/space/">CDL’s Space Stream</a> and advise its R&amp;D team on expanding research-grade databases for entrepreneurship studies.</p>

<p>My research examines how information asymmetries and heterogeneous beliefs shape entrepreneurial decision-making and firm development. I study how differences in what entrepreneurs, investors, and employees know—and believe—about startup quality affect critical early-stage outcomes. My work reveals why seemingly implausible ideas sometimes generate extraordinary value while obvious opportunities often fail, and how structured approaches to learning can improve entrepreneurial resource allocation.</p>

<p>During my doctoral studies, I built a large-scale relational database on early-stage entrepreneurship, combining structured operational data with unstructured transcripts of mentor-founder interactions across 27 technological domains. This infrastructure secured $25 million from the Government of Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund and now supports four published papers and fifteen projects in progress across multiple institutions.</p>

<p>My research has been published in <em>Management Science</em> and <em>American Economic Journal</em>, featured in <em>The Economist</em>, <em>Globe and Mail</em>, and <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine</em>, and recognized with the Heizer Dissertation Award and the Royal Bank of Canada’s Borealis AI Fellowship.</p>

<p>I completed my doctoral studies at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.</p>

<p>When not teaching or researching, I enjoy skiing, playing tennis, learning new pieces on the piano and violin, or renting a small aircraft to explore new places.</p>
